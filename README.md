# WhisperTranscriptionWebInterface
React/TypeScript/NodeJS front end for Whisper. Transcribes audio and video (english or french) into text and provides a basic interface for grouping the transcribed text into logical groupings (typically speakers).

Whister is and Open Source project from Open AI (https://openai.com/index/whisper/) and is one GitHub with an MIT license (https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/LICENSE).

It does all the hard work of transcribing and is as good as any automated transcripts that I have seen.

I ran accross a need to have a need to do such transcriptions on files that I wanted tight control over and no Internet access to and it only took a couple of hours to install it and do a simple proof-of-concept from the command line.

Putting a web front-end on it just makes it easier to use within our household and also provides a place to so some simple organizing of the raw, transcribed data.
